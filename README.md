# self-improvement-game
i've had this idea for a couple of weeks. i
've realised that games are bullshit, you level up in the game, but you decrease your level in real life.
what's the point of that? so, i hopped on notion 2 days ago, i created the game and i have some plans for it. 
be ready. 
a summary of the game is that for every productive thing i do, i get exp, when i get 1000 exp, i level up. when i'm level 100, i prestige. 
i have more plans for it, such as weekly missions and shit like that. star this repo plz.
